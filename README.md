Let's code Spring Integration

This code looks at `basics` in the basics module. 

This code also looks at file based integration, and relies on an FTP Server that [we created in this repository](https://github.com/coffee-software-show/lets-code-apache-ftpserver). Start up that before looking at `files/ftp-client-integration`
